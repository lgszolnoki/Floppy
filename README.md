2023 I got a couple of 5.25" floppy disk from the late 80s. All used in earlier PCs built in the GDR with corresponding formating. 
My first attempts to hande them with a modern PC failed. So I decided to build a CP/M 2.2 based retro computer. 
I learned RomWBW and was immediately determined to use it as my software base. # Overview
